# BloonsMacros

These AutoHotkey macro scripts assisted me in setting an all-time world record in the game Bloons TD 5!

**RoundStartWithAbilities** - automatically activates the 'GO' button and clicks at the 2nd ability slot at an interval (Spike Storms), and clicks the first and third ability slot at another different interval (Sabo, and CTA in my case).

**SniperUpgrades** - upgrades Sniper towers to 4-0, targets them to close, and then has a 50/50 chance of buying the first upgrade on the right path (4-1).

**TemplePlacements3TA** - I mapped the best possible temple placements on the track 3 Times Around, and made a script that automatically places Super Monkeys in their pixel-perfect positions on the track.
